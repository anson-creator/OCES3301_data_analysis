    "Apply what you learnt so far to the El-Nino 3.4 data (probably start with SST first). The code to read the SST data and generate the associated time array has been done for you below. Few things to remember and to try are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The time units here are in *years* because of how I made the time array (see *07_time_series*).\n",
    "* Since the data series is long, there is a global warming trend in the signal that you probably need to deal with.\n",
    "* El Nino normally occurs between 2 to 7 *years*.\n",
    "* Consider filtering out anything that is outside of the El Nino range to see what might be the associated El Nino signal on SST / chlorophyll / phytoplankton / OLR.\n",
    "* There are some signals outside of the El Nino range that are physical (e.g. the 1 year one, the 0.5 year one, 10-20 year ones), may want to speculate what those are.\n",
    "* Consider filtering in physical space first, before doing spectrum analysis, or vice-versa.\n",
    "* Consider windowing chunks of the signal and computing the power spectrum of the windowed signal. Now that you have power spectrum sample over different chunks of time, consider doing statistics on these chunks in time (e.g. accumulate the spectrum, computing some sort of \"average\" of spectrum). Maybe even cook up some hypothesis tests (cf. *05/06_statistical_tests*)."
