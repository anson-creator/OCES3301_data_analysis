# OCES 3301 Data Analysis in Ocean Science

NOTE: I happen to be using some data relevant to ocean science, otherwise the "Ocean Science" bit is neither here nor there.

Material mostly in the notebooks. At least three known ways of running these:

1) On your computer, by downloading the pack (there should be a green "code" button near the top right of this page, click it and there should be "download")

2) On your computer, `git clone` this repository. Then you can do `git pull` you get updates (if any). You may or may not want to fork the repository (need a GitHub account), then you can commit changes too.

3) In Google colab, but you will need to pull copies (code and data) to your own Google drive, otherwise changes are not saved.

Clicking the icon below will open a temporary Colab instance, where changes are by default not saved (and you will need to pull the data files with `!wget` commands that are currently commented out in the notebooks). There should be a "copy to drive button" near "file" near the top left for copying to drive.

NOTE (09 Apr 22): The larger data files are managed through the [GitHub LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/). This has been a (isolated?) problem on a Mac when doing `git clone/update` in the terminal, but has not been an issue on the two Linux computers I have access to. Please let me know if there are problems in cloning/updating, and I might consider splitting the repositories into a "code" and "data" one, where the data can be accessed through appropriate `!wget` commands.

known things to add:

* other resources
* some yaml / requirment.txt?
