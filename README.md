# OCES 3301 Data Analysis in Ocean Science

Material mostly in the notebooks. At least three known ways of running these:

1) On your computer, by downloading the pack (there should be a green download button near the top right)

2) On your computer, `git clone` this repositor, then if you `git pull` you get updates (if any)

3) In Google colab, but you might need to make copies to your own Google drive, otherwise changes are not saved.

Clicking the icone below opening a Colab instance but changes are by default not saved (and you will need to pull the data files with `!wget` commands that are currently commented out in the notebooks)

known things to add:

* some yaml / requirment.txt?
