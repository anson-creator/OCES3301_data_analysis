# OCES 3301 Data Analysis in Ocean Science

Material mostly in the notebooks. At least three known ways of running these:

1) On your computer, by downloading the pack (there should be a green "code" button near the top right of this page, click it and there should be "download")

2) On your computer, `git clone` this repository. Then you can do `git pull` you get updates (if any). You may or may not want to fork the repository (need a GitHub account), then you can commit changes too.

3) In Google colab, but you will need to pull copies to your own Google drive, otherwise changes are not saved.

Clicking the icon below will open a temporary Colab instance, where changes are by default not saved (and you will need to pull the data files with `!wget` commands that are currently commented out in the notebooks). There should be a "copy to drive button" near "file" near the top left for copying to drive.

known things to add:

* other resources
* some yaml / requirment.txt?
