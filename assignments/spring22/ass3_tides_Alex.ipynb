    "### General spiel about assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "***Your hand in should be in the form of a Jupyter notebook and associated files (if any), and no other form of hand-ins will be accepted***. The use of Jupyter notebook and its Python component is part of the *presentation* and *coding* assessment criteria. Submit the notebooks through Canvas in the usual way. You are graded on the following attributes (yes the total adds up to 110%, that is intended):\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **scientific content** (50%)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **writing, presentation and referencing** (35%)\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **use of Jupyter and/or Python coding** (15%)\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **originality** (10%; analysis beyond scope of course, use of memes and puns; surprise me)\n",
    "\n",
    "Anything above 100% is just going to be 100%, although there may be a course prize of sorts at the end. The intention here is that there is credit you can get for \"extras\", but really the bulk of the credit comes from the \"basic\" things.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the model assignments I've made for the kind of things we might be expecting. We will probably be fairly loose with giving credit, but 60% or below would count as unsatisfactory (85% or above would be an A grade I would imagine).\n",
    "\n",
    "You are allowed to use other Python packages if you find them, but see point b) below.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) ***Late assignments get a penalty of 1% of full marks per minute*** (so don't bother handing in anything after 2 hours). We will still mark it and give feedback, but you just don't get the credit. Excuses could be entertained but you will need sufficient evidence to back these up (e.g. your internet went down in the area and you have some pictorial/written demonstration for this).\n",
    "\n",
    "b) ***Your code needs to be able to run from scratch at least in the standard Google Colab, or with appropriate `pip` commands to call extra modules***, otherwise you will get no marks from the 3rd attribute, and probably next to nothing in the 1st attribute (because your graphs probably won't be generating). When you hand the notebooks in, you should pass it through `Kernel -> Restarts & Clear Output`, so the file is reasonably sized and only full of text (and if you don't *you get a 10% penalty* for not following instructions, for reasons in point c) below). The procedure here is that we will run the whole notebook from scratch probably on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), then mark the resulting outputs. We will do reasonable attempts to get the notebook running (though \"reasonable\" is loosely defined). To avoid the issue entirely, **make sure you test your code through Google Colab before you hand in!** (or do your assignments on there, find whatever work flow that works for you).\n",
    "\n",
    "c) ***Plagiarism***: By all means consult each other and/or work together, but the files you hand in should be done and written up separately. For allowing checks in Turnitin, you should pass it through `Kernel -> Restarts & Clear Output` before you hand it in, otherwise *you get a 10% penalty* for not following instructions. **The default for anyone accused with plagiarism is ZERO on the assignment**, and depending on whether you decide to contest and the result of the appeal, possibly lead to an official note of plagiarism on your transcript or more (I will allow people to argue but one should be ready for the consequences). \n",
    "\n",
    "A few things count as plagiarism:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Copying between students, and the default is that ALL parties involved get zero for the assignment**, regardless of whether the side can demonstrate they were copied from (extra incentive to keep the writing separate).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Copying text without citation is plagiarism**. Use quotation marks and give references if you are directly lifting text, but don't do this too often (as this will result in text looking cluttered, and not getting full credit for the *presentation* aspect).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code is a slightly more grey area**. I will just say no one has ever really been punished for being cautious and generous with citations, but make sure you present it well (e.g. overburdening text with citations will make the presentation ugly, and will not get full credit for the *presentation* aspect say).\n",
    "\n",
    "I will just make the point that we don't tend to accuse plagiarism unless we have enough proof, and if we are doing it it probably means we think we have a sufficiently strong case that is probably not worth arguing against (because then penalty then gets increased)."

    "\n",
    "[Alex Wyatt](http://www.alexsjwyatt.com/) has a paper in Nature Geoscience [(see here)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0486-4) about internal waves and their impact on heat stress on coral reef ecosystems. The data here is in-situ observations of temperature, and is given in the supplementary material (e.g. [data from Iriomote-jima](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.906169), but there are others in the collection). \n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment here is to analyse the relevant data using the tools you've learnt so far, with a focus on the time-series techniques given in `07/08_time_series.ipynb`; there might be material from the previous sessions that are also applicable, but the focus will be on `07` and `08`. Have a look at the published paper and try and reproduce some related diagrams in that paper, and say a bit about what your analysis is showing. \n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE: You will not get exactly the same thing probably since the methods being used are slightly different, but it should not be drastically different.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it slightly more interesting (but possibly slightly painful for me), for this assessment I am not going to give you the cleaned up data, and it is your job procure the data (see screenshot below) and bully the data (*hint hint*) and/or Python code read the data.\n",

    "  * the spectrum computed from the 2 min frequency data being the gold standard\n",

    "a) some background reading/research into physical-ecological interactions [*be able to do some background research*]\n",
    "\n",
    "b) demonstrate awareness of the need to procure, tidying up and/or reading of data [*data management, pre-processing, Python competence*]\n",
    "\n",
    "c) basic understanding and/or mastery of material relating to time-series analysis [*practise and demonstrate understanding of tools and Python code and time-series analysis techniques*]\n",
